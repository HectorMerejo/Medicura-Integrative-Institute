            <h2>What to Expect: Your First Visit FAQ</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Q: How long is the initial appointment?</h3>
              <p>
                A: Your first visit lasts approximately 2 to 2.5 hours, allowing
                time for a full diagnostic workup, body-systems review,
                traditional analysis, and personalized treatment planning.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Q: What should I bring?</h3>
              <p>
                A: Please bring any recent lab work, imaging reports, a list of
                current supplements and medications, and any relevant medical
                records. Intake forms will be sent to you in advance.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Q: Will I receive treatment during the first visit?</h3>
              <p>
                A: Yes, in most cases. Once the diagnostic evaluation is
                complete, you may receive a gentle introduction to one or more
                modalities—such as acupuncture, cupping, herbal therapy, or
                lifestyle recommendations—depending on your presentation and
                readiness.

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Q: What should I wear?</h3>
              <p>
                A: Comfortable clothing is recommended. Gowns or draping will be
                provided as needed, and you’ll always be treated with the utmost
                care and professionalism.
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                A: Follow-up appointments typically last 60 minutes, with
                30-minute sessions available for focused treatments such as
                maintenance acupuncture, cupping, or herbal consults.

              <p>
                A: Depending on your provider and plan, some treatments may be
                eligible for reimbursement. Superbills can be provided upon
                request, and flexible payment plans are available for
                longer-term care programs.
