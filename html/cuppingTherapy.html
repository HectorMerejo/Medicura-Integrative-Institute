              Cupping therapy is a traditional technique used across many
              cultures—most notably within Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)—in
              which glass, silicone, or bamboo cups are applied to the skin to
              create suction. This gentle vacuum draws the skin and superficial
              muscle layer into the cup, promoting blood flow, loosening fascia,
              and facilitating detoxification through the lymphatic system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Far from being just a trend, cupping has been validated by modern
              research for its role in pain reduction, inflammation modulation,
              and muscular recovery, making it a valuable adjunct to both
              traditional and contemporary medical care.

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              Cupping therapy is typically painless and deeply relaxing. You may
              feel a pulling or stretching sensation in the targeted area as
              circulation is stimulated. After treatment, it’s common to see
              temporary round marks or discoloration on the skin—these are not
              bruises, but signs of stagnation being released and processed by
              the body. These marks fade naturally within a few days.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my clinic, cupping is often combined with acupuncture, manual
              therapies, or herbal liniments for a synergistic effect that
              enhances outcomes. It is tailored to your specific condition,
              pressure tolerance, and overall treatment goals.
