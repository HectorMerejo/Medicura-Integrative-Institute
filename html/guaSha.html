              Gua Sha is a time-honored manual therapy rooted in Traditional
              Chinese Medicine that involves gently scraping the skin with a
              smooth-edged tool—typically made of jade, horn, ceramic, or
              stone—to promote circulation, release stagnation, and encourage
              the body’s natural healing processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its ancient origins, Gua Sha has gained increasing
              recognition in modern integrative medicine for its therapeutic
              benefits in musculoskeletal pain, inflammation, tension, and
              immune regulation. The technique works by stimulating the surface
              of the skin and underlying fascia to increase microcirculation,
              break up myofascial adhesions, and enhance lymphatic drainage.

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              Gua Sha is a gentle but deeply effective treatment. While some
              mild redness or petechiae (tiny red spots) may appear after the
              session, this is a natural response and typically resolves within
              a few days. Most patients describe the treatment as soothing,
              relieving, and deeply satisfying, especially when tension or
              stagnation is present.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my practice, Gua Sha is often integrated into broader treatment
              sessions—such as acupuncture, cupping, or herbal therapy—to create
              a multidimensional therapeutic experience that supports healing
              from every angle.
