            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
              At the core of my practice is a unique model of care—where modern
              medical diagnostics meet upscale spa comfort and the warmth of
              personalized hospitality. Your initial visit isn’t just a
              check-up; it’s an experience designed to completely reframe what
              healthcare can feel like.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Comprehensive Medical Examination is a two to
              two-and-a-half-hour appointment that combines cutting-edge
              diagnostic tools, physical assessment, and mind-body-soul
              evaluation to uncover the true root of your health concerns. From
              the moment you arrive, you’re welcomed into a serene, carefully
              curated space.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is not routine medicine—it is restorative care delivered with
              reverence, precision, and intention.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your experience is curated to feel grounding, spacious, and
              collaborative. From the first consultation, we begin forming a
              therapeutic relationship centered around trust, clarity, and
              long-term transformation. Every modality offered is rooted in
              scientific evidence and adapted to your comfort, cultural
              background, and personal preferences.
            </p>

            <p>
              My diagnostic process doesn’t just look for disease—it seeks
              patterns, imbalances, and potential. We treat what’s present,
              support what’s vulnerable, and strengthen what’s vital. Whether
              you’re coming in for complex chronic conditions, preventative
              wellness, or simply to feel more like yourself again, this
              examination becomes the foundation for everything that follows.
            </p>

            <p>
              Healing should not feel rushed. It should feel like you matter.
              And in this space, you do.

            <h2>Global & Genetic Herbal Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to the rich system of TCM, I take a genetic and
              geographic approach to healing—incorporating herbs that are native
              to the regions aligned with your ancestral roots. From African
              tonics and Caribbean bitters, to Western nervines, Andean
              adaptogens, and Egyptian resins, I draw upon thousands of
              medicinal plants across global healing traditions to design
              formulas that resonate with your biology and your lineage.
            </p>

            <p>
              This approach is not just symbolic—it is functional. The synergy
              between a patient’s DNA and indigenous plant life often enhances
              bioavailability and response, particularly when used alongside
              Chinese or functional medicine herbs.
            </p>

          <section class="service-section">
            <h2>Quality You Can Trust</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Certified organic</li>
              <li>Ethically and sustainably sourced</li>
              <li>Medical grade, tested for potency and purity</li>
              <li>Backed by both ancient use and modern research</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Every formula is evidence-based, clinically informed, and
              continuously adjusted to ensure it evolves with your healing
              journey. Whether you’re managing a complex condition or optimizing
              wellness, your herbal prescription is designed to be as dynamic
              and adaptable as you are.
